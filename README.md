  ###Recommendation and findings 
 1.    Regional Strategy:
         North region appears to lead in sales volume and revenue. 
         Recommendation: Strengthen distribution and customer engagement in the North since it’s a proven high-demand market.
         West region lags behind. 
         Recommendation: Introduce targeted promotions, discount campaigns, or additional training for sales reps in the West to 
             boost performance
              
  2.   Product Category Focus:
          Electronics dominate overall revenue (high-priced items like laptops and smartphones).
            Recommendation: Increase inventory for fast-moving electronics and explore bundling strategies (e.g., Laptop + Headphones 
          packages).
          Stationery has high unit sales but low revenue contribution.
            Recommendation: Position stationery as an upsell/cross-sell with electronics or furniture to increase average order value.
  3.   Salesperson Performance:
          James and Grace are consistent top performers.
            Recommendation: Recognize and reward them to sustain motivation. Also, share their best practices across the team.
          Sarah’s sales are weaker in some regions.
            Recommendation: Provide mentorship, product training, and regional support to help her improve.
   4.   Time-Based Insights:
          Sales peak mid-January but drop off towards late February.
            Recommendation: Plan seasonal promotions around early and mid-month when demand is highest. Consider loyalty programs to 
            maintain momentum during slow weeks.
